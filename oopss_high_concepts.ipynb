    "\n",
    "#Reduced Coupling: By hiding internal implementation details, objects or modules become less coupled, making it easier to modify or replace one component without affecting others.\n",
    "#Improved Modularity: Information hiding enables modular code, where each module is self-contained and independent, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain.\n",
    "#Increased Security: Hiding internal implementation details reduces the risk of unauthorized access or tampering with sensitive data or logic.\n",
    "#Simplified Code Maintenance: With information hiding, changes to internal implementation details do not affect the external interface, making it easier to maintain and update code.\n",
    "#Better Abstraction: Information hiding enables better abstraction, allowing developers to focus on the essential features and behaviors of an object or module, rather than its internal workings.\n",
    "#Improved Code Reusability: By hiding internal implementation details, objects or modules become more reusable, as they can be easily integrated into different contexts without exposing their internal workings.\n",
    "#Easier Testing: Information hiding makes it easier to test code, as the internal implementation details are isolated, and only the public interface needs to be tested.\n",
    "#Benefits of Information Hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Improved Code Quality: Information hiding leads to better-organized, modular, and maintainable code.\n",
    "#Reduced Complexity: By hiding internal implementation details, the complexity of the code is reduced, making it easier to understand and work with.\n",
    "#Increased Flexibility: Information hiding enables developers to change internal implementation details without affecting the external interface, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.\n",

    "#An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a high-level description of a data type that defines how the data type can be manipulated, without specifying how the data type is implemented. In other words, an ADT defines the interface or contract that a data type must adhere to, without caring about the internal implementation details.\n",
    "#Key characteristics of ADTs:\n",
    "#Abstract: ADTs are abstract, meaning they don't specify how the data type is implemented.\n",
    "#High-level description: ADTs provide a high-level description of the data type, focusing on the operations that can be performed on the data type.\n",
    "#Interface-based: ADTs define an interface or contract that must be implemented by any concrete data type that claims to be an instance of the ADT.\n",
    "#Examples of ADTs:\n",
    "#Stack: A stack is an ADT that defines a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, with operations like push, pop, and peek.\n",
    "#Queue: A queue is an ADT that defines a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, with operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek.\n",
    "#Set: A set is an ADT that defines an unordered collection of unique elements, with operations like add, remove, and contains.\n",
    "#Decoupling implementation from interface: ADTs separate the interface (the operations that can be performed on the data type) from the implementation (how the data type is actually implemented). This decoupling allows for different implementations of the same ADT, without affecting the code that uses the ADT.\n",
    "#Encapsulation: ADTs encapsulate the internal implementation details of a data type, making it harder for external code to access or modify the internal state of the data type.\n",
    "#Polymorphism: ADTs enable polymorphism, as different implementations of the same ADT can be used interchangeably, without affecting the code that uses the ADT\n",

    "#2.Develop and test individual components: You can focus on developing and testing each component independently, reducing the complexity of the overall system.\n",
    "#3.Swap or replace components: If needed, you can replace or swap out individual components without affecting the entire system, making it more flexible and adaptable.\n",
    "#Maintainability\n",
    "#1.Composition enhances maintainability in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#2.Easier debugging: With composition, you can isolate and debug individual components, reducing the time and effort required to identify and fix issues.\n",
    "#3.Less coupling: Composition reduces coupling between components, making it easier to modify or update individual components without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
    "#4.Improved code organization: Composition encourages a more organized code structure, with each component having a clear and well-defined role, making it easier to understand and navigate the codebase.\n",
    "#5.Reusability: Components can be reused across different parts of the system, reducing code duplication and making it easier to maintain consistency.\n",

    "#In Python, composition is particularly beneficial due to the language's dynamic nature and flexibility. Python's composition capabilities are enhanced by:\n",
    "#Duck typing: Python's duck typing allows you to define interfaces and protocols that can be implemented by multiple classes, making it easier to compose objects from different classes.\n",
    "#Dynamic method resolution: Python's dynamic method resolution enables you to call methods on objects without knowing their exact class, making it easier to compose objects and delegate responsibilities.\n",
